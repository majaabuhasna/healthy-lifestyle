    <h1>Healthy Lifestyle</h1>
    <h2>Health Categories</h2>
    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which 
        an organism uses food and water to support its life. The intake
        of these substances provides organisms with nutrients (divided into macro- and micro-) 
        which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures; too much or too little 
        of an essential nutrient can cause malnutrition. Nutritional science, the study of nutrition 
        as a hard science, typically emphasizes human nutrition.</p>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Exercise or working out is physical activity that enhances or 
        maintains fitness and overall health.It is performed for various reasons, 
        including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, 
        develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, improve health, 
        or simply for enjoyment. Many people choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, 
        socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.</p>
    <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which consciousness 
        is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. During sleep,
        there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the
        surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli,
        it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.</p>
