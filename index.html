    <h1>Healthy Lifestyle</h1>

    <h2>Health Categories</h2>
    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        <p>Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which 
        an organism uses food and water to support its life. The intake
        of these substances provides organisms with nutrients (divided into macro- and micro-) 
        which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures; too much or too little 
        of an essential nutrient can cause malnutrition. Nutritional science, the study of nutrition 
        as a hard science, typically emphasizes human nutrition.</p>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Exercise or working out is physical activity that enhances or 
        maintains fitness and overall health.It is performed for various reasons, 
        including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, 
        develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, improve health, 
        or simply for enjoyment. Many people choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, 
        socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.</p>
    <h3>Sleep</h3>
        <p>Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which consciousness 
        is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. During sleep,
        there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the
        surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli,
        it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.</p>

    <h2>Healthy habits</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Do a morning stretch</h3>
            <p>Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, 
            improves circulation, and promotes relaxation, helping to set the day's tone.
            While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and release your lower limbs several times.
            Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your legs still elevated,
            flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly look left and then right.
            Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and close your hands repeatedly.</p>

        <li><h3>Stay hydrated</h3>
            <p>Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance,
                and increases energy, among other health benefits. Drink a big glass of water after
                you wake up and a glass with every meal.</p>

        </li>
        <li><h3>Apply sunscreen</h3>
            <p>Sunscreen is the best defense against skin-damaging rays.
                After washing your face in the morning, apply a facial moisturizer that contains sunscreen
                with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. Or blend equal parts sunscreen and a regular moisturizer.
                Use one or two nickel-sized dollops to cover your entire face, neck, ears,
                and any bald or thinning spots on your head.</p>

        </li>
        <li><h3>Enjoy a hobby</h3>
            <p>A study published online Sept. 11, 2023, by Nature Medicine suggests that
                having a hobby is good for people's overall health and mood. Hobbies involve creativity,
                sensory engagement, self-expression, relaxation, and cognitive stimulation.
                One way to pick up a new hobby is with a project kit designed to teach you a skill like gardening,
                building a model, carving wood, or making beer, soap, hot sauce, or jewelry.
                The kits come with instructions and all the materials you need to start.
                You can find kits at local bookstores or hobby stores, or go online: just type
                "how-to kits" or "project kits" into a search engine.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Be social</h3>
            <p>Social interactions can stave off loneliness and protect against depression
                and cognitive decline. Strive to have some kind of social engagement every day:
                make a phone call, send an email, or chat with a neighbor. Another option is to
                create your own social pod â€” a small, intimate group that you interact with regularly,
                like meeting for coffee or conversing over a Zoom call. Casual conversations are also helpful;
                for example, chat with a grocery store employee or interact with a stranger on the street.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
